# Gridly CSS Framework

Gridly is a combination of many ideas of how CSS Grid frameworks, 
its primary goal is to allow the designer to think outside the box by introducing boxes...

I know it sound odd but the theory is that many of the CSS Grid frameworks us 
negative values to fit edge to edge content and remove gutters between the content areas.

The grid is % based and covers 12, 16 and 24 columns as well as full width and contained width. 
SCSS SASS files enable greater control of the CSS and media queries.

Mobile first methodolgy is also the foundation of the system.
